# Scheidify
The internet can be frustrating and full of bullshit. Scheidify is a little [browser extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scheidify/noehlhgcfmnllodacehfablpkegjdkho) that can help make the internet a better place. It adds a little button to your toolbar that lets you "scheidify" any website instantly by replacing images with empowering and fun graphics and gifs celebrating badassery and vaginas.

Writing an extension for Chrome is surprisingly easy – and you can do it, too! **[Go here for the tutorial](http://ines.io/blog/browser-extension-for-more-everyday-life-badassery)**. I'll explain how Scheidify was built and how you can make your own badass browser extension.
